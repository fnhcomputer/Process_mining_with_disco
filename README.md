# Process Mining with Jupyter Notebook and Disco


Disco

Process Mining software Disco was developed from scratch with the goal to make Process Mining accessible for business users. Disco’s framework is based on proven scientific research and it has been in use in various industries with use cases like customer journey analysis, audit, process improvement and optimization. The tool allows an easy and flexible discovery of processes with its visualization and filtering capabilities. Fluxicon also organizes the annual Process Mining Camp, has written the “Process Mining in Practice” book that defines the process mining methodology for practitioners, and supports close to 700 universities through the Fluxicon Academic Initiative.
